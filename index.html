                        <h2>Recruiter</h2>
                        <p>I worked for a company called TEKsystems for 7 months. They are the largest IT staffing and services company in North America. In the United States they have 109 offices and in Wisconsin they have 4 offices. I sat in the Brookfield office which serviced all of the Greater Milwaukee Area. Our office worked with over 80 clients such as, Northwestern Mutual, Johnson Controls, Generac, and Rockwell.</p>

                        <p>In my time there I was able to build relationships with IT professionals in the area through various networking events and meet ups and stayed up to date on local market trends. I hit many milestones and forged great relationships while working at TEKsystems and was able to acquire insight into what companies are looking for in the Greater Milwaukee area. </p>
