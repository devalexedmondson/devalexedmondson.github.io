                            <p>I worked for a company called TEKsystems for 7 months. They are the largest IT staffing and services company in North America. In the United States they have 109 offices and in Wisconsin they have 4 offices. I sat in the Brookfield office which serviced all of the Greater Milwaukee Area. Our office worked with over 80 clients such as, Northwestern Mutual, Johnson Controls, Generac, and Rockwell.</p>

                            <p>In my time there I was able to build relationships with IT professionals in the area through various networking events and meet ups and stayed up to date on local market trends. I hit many milestones and forged great relationships while working at TEKsystems and was able to acquire insight into what companies are looking for in the Greater Milwaukee area. </p>

                            <h2 class="page-header">The Shift</h2>
                            <p>After working at TEKsystems for a while I started to realize that I was missing something in my life. I enjoyed my job due to the fact that I was able to interact with IT professionals on a daily basis. I enjoyed learning about the project that people were working on and loved hearing about the types of environments they worked in.</p>
                        
                        <p>Even with that I still felt as if I was missing something but could never  figure it out what was missing. Eventually I did. I decided to persue a career in Software Development myself by attending DevCodeCamp.</p>

                            <p>Right now I am attending devCodeCamp which is teaching me the skills that I need to become a Full Stack Developer. It is a three month immersive bootcamp that covers skills such as html/css, Javascript, and C#. My goal is to obtain a job in Software Development that will allow me to solve interesting business challenges every day.</p>
