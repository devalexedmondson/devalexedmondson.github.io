                            <p>My immediate family is fairly small. I grew up with my Mom, Dad, and one brother. My mom grew up in Grand Rapids, MI and eventually moved to Hinkley Big Rock, IL where she met my Dad. They started dating in high school and have been together ever since then. I have one brother that is 16 months younger than I am.</p>

                            <p>I was lucky growing up to have most of the schools that I went to be so close to home. My elementary school, middle school, and high school were all within walking distance from me which made the commute great. I attended Waubonsie Valley High School and played basketball all four years. For college I decided to stay close to home and attend Benedictine University where I finished with a degree in Communications and also played varsity basketball all four years.</p>

Although I did not recieve a scholorship, I decided to play basketball in college at Benedictine University. While at Benedictine University I played varsity basketball all four years.</p>
