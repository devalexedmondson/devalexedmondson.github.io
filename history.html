                    <h3>Family</h3>

                    <p>My immediate family is fairly small. I grew up with my Mom, Dad, and one brother. My mom grew up in Grand Rapids, MI and eventually moved to Hinkley Big Rock, IL where she met my Dad. They started dating in high school and have been together ever since then. I have one brother that is 16 months younger than I am. </p>

                    <h3>School</h3>
                    <p>I was lucky growing up to have most of the schools that I went to be so close to home. My elementary school, middle school, and high school were all within walking distance from me which made the commute great. I attended Waubonsie Valley High School and played basketball all four years. For college I decided to stay close to home and attend Benedictine University where I finished with a degree in Communications and also played varsity basketball all four years.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4">
                    <h3>Sports</h3>
                    <p>I've been playing sports all my life but have always loved to play basketball. I started playing when I was six years old and was really trying to follow in my Dad's footsteps. My Dad played college basketball at Northern Illinois University and recieved a full athletic scholorship to play there. Although I did not recieve a scholorship, I decided to play basketball in college at Benedictine University. While at Benedictine University I played varsity basketball all four years.</p>

            <h3>Work Life</h3>
            <p>After graduating from Benedictine University I decided to take a job for a local start-up company called, M14 Hoops Academy. I stayed at this job for a year and half before moving to Milwaukee and starting my career in sales. I started at a small company called Solvy7 and later moved to TEKsystems to become a recruiter. Most recently I left TEKsystems to pursue a career in Software Devlopment by attending devCodeCamp. </p>
