    <h3>Recruiting</h3> 
        
        <p>I worked for a company called TEKsystems. They are the largest IT staffing and services company in North America. In the United States they have 109 offices and in Wisconsin they have 4 offices. I sat in the Brookfield office which serviced all of the Greater Milwaukee Area. Our office worked with over 80 clients such as, Northwestern Mutual, Johnson Controls, Generac, and Rockwell.</p>
                
        <p>In my time there I was able to build relationships with IT professionals in the area through various networking events and meet ups and stayed up to date on local market trends. I hit may milestones and forged great relationships while working at TEKsystems and was able to aquire insight into what companies are looking for in the Greater Milwaukee area. </p>

            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
